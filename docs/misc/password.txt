<raistlin> from what i saw u were
<raistlin> working on password.dll module stuff
<raistlin> is it any similar to sc2?
<raistlin> i had created the battlenger for sc2
<raistlin> where u could login bnet2 servers
<raistlin> if u remember i had pmed u on
<raistlin> mmowned.com
<[TOM_RUS]> it's save as in wow or Sc2 atm
<raistlin> and asked a few question
<[TOM_RUS]> same*
<raistlin> oh with different password.dll module hashes i guess?
<[TOM_RUS]> no
<[TOM_RUS]> same module
<raistlin> oh
<raistlin> so u done with modulemessage stuff on ur repo? didnt check it lately

<[TOM_RUS]> 8f52906a2c85b416a595702251570f96d3522f39237603115f2f1ab24962043c.auth
<raistlin> and still a srp6 goes in for handshake right?
<raistlin> from what i know in sc2, after auth and handshake all data was encrypted
<[TOM_RUS]> it's not 100% completed, because I cant figure out one thing after srp complete
<raistlin> i'm curious why 
<raistlin> they did not do same for d3
<raistlin> i mean packet encrypting
<raistlin> on what's that needs to be figured?


<[TOM_RUS]> well, I may have an answer why they not using encryption yet
<[TOM_RUS]> theirs auth code seems to be incomplete
<[TOM_RUS]> session key generated by password.dll isn't used anywhere
<raistlin> oh
<[TOM_RUS]> my guess they will implement encryption in later builds
<raistlin> so c-s just handshakes and don't use 
<raistlin> the generated keys for seesion
<raistlin> and just goes on plain
<raistlin> lol

<[TOM_RUS]> auth itself works fine, because client ignores battle.net error 103 triggered by Password.dll
<[TOM_RUS]> but if they implement encryption, they will most likely also check for erros
